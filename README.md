## Installing and running

- Get yourself a Pushbullet API key
- Clone the repo
- Navigate in and type `yarn`
- Wait while yarn does its thing :thinking:
- `PUSHBULLET_API_KEY=$YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE node index.js` or _chmod_ it (`chmod +x index.js`) and `PUSHBULLET_API_KEY=$YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE ./index.js`

You can also add this to `rc.local` or something along those lines if you with for it to start when you boot your computer.
